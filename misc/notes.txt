GET could not sen a "long" variable.
However curl url?uid=2   was fine with String.

In fact the GET method was working correctly.

    //A 'json' is the set of public get*() methods of a POJO.
From stack overflow [David Lotts]: "make sure the POJO you return has get()ers, one for each field."


GET does not work with json input.

Long works (instead of long) in GET.

@RequestMapping("/userfullstate")
can be wither for a function or a class.

is
@ResponseBody
optional?  (for the function)

Model:
"Primarily designed for adding attributes to the model."

But the object is different each time.
Besides, where is it constructed? Using what parameters?

A model as an arg is constructed at each REST request. (then what is the point?)
Why??? #Q #unresolved

A this.model (in the controller class) is created once. Appears quite early in logs.

Which one is injection then?

------------
`@Service` is a subtype of @Component
@Service: "Service", originally defined by Domain-Driven
           * Design (Evans, 2003) as "an operation offered as an interface that stands alone in the
           * model, with no encapsulated state." []

`@Controller`
is typically used in combination with annotated handler methods based on the
 * {@link org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping} annotation.

`java -ea` enables assert
mvn clean install ;blines ;java -ea -jar target/gs-spring-boot-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Works. 16:25 (compiles without error)
Both @Value and @Bean are required.
Q: How to make a Bean that is Injected in properties of two @Components?

echo;curl localhost:8080/userfullstate?uid=2;echo;echo     #exception
echo;curl localhost:8080/userfullstate?uid=7;echo;echo     #works fine. cool.
echo;curl localhost:8080/gamestate;echo;echo               #empty output


Is UserState a Bean? Or is it part of the GameInstance (getter)

UserState is probably Not a bean. [DesignDecision]

Works!

{"players":[{"publicName":"Jack","summary":{"summary":"Name:Jack OnApp: false","vlong":5},"privateName":"Jack","onScreen":false}],"playerCount":1}

The getters provide all needed (also the summary and the view).

On @Bean methods:
A @Bean (method) will be executed once even if called multiple times. (Any @Bean in a @Configuration)
If a @BEan in @Component class, it will be called 3 times ( N+1 times)!

parameters of @Bean methods: are injected.(?)

alternatives to singleton @Beans: sessions scope, request scope.

* A controller should not be void?
I only used a @RequestMapping(...) without @ResponseBody

> Servlet.service() for servlet [dispatcherServlet] in context with path [] threw exception [Circular view path [choose]: would dispatch back to the current handler URL [/choose] again. Check your ViewResolver setup!
> (Hint: This may be the result of an unspecified view, due to default view name generation.)
> ] with root cause

@ResponseBody:
Annotation that indicates a method return value should be bound to the web response body.
.. * added on "type level" vs. added on the "method level".
** @see RequestBody
** @see RestController

@RestController = a @Controller class where @RequestMapping  methods => @ResponseBody
But is "/choose" a REST Controller?

Works!

The method's return type is "@ResponseBody void"

todo: set the timestamp of last change when "/choose".

@ResponseBody void

git:commit summary:
"the /choose endpoint added and works, java mail sender imported but not used. @ResponseBody void is type annotation. It is required for the endpoint. But is it REST?"


Who sets the timestamp (for the vote/choice)? When is it set?
At frontend? the caller of the rest? The REST method?
How many timestamps should we save?
How many timestamps can exist (in total)?

Port changed:
mvn clean install ;blines ;java -ea -jar target/gs-spring-boot-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8181 &

> The @Resource annotation marks a resource that is needed by the application.

A bean can be injected twice.
But a POJO (that ias not a @Component) cannot use @Property field (if uses, it is not injected).

Security now works:
Based on two things:
http://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-security/3.2.0.RELEASE/apidocs/org/springframework/security/config/annotation/web/configuration/EnableWebSecurity.html
( g: @EnableWebSecurity )
and:

todo: Difererntiate: SSL, SSH, OAuth, etc
todo: OAuth

Just adding <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId> to maven enables security.
Without the configuration class, (but using the artifact/dependency,) a dialogue box appears. Using configuration, a form appears.

            mthd(Map<String, Object> model) {}
            //Understanding:
            //   the model is actually an output. It constitutes the "request" (GET/POST) to the page x, where String x is returned.
Question: Is that request a POST or a GET then?

Using import org.springframework.ui.Model;
did not help.


For test:
1- Make sure you use the right dependency.
     The package needed is spring-boot-starter-test and NOT spring-test and NOT junit.
     static imports. org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo ,etc   equalTo, content, status. These are methods directly imported!
2- Make sure you instantiate the right class (HomePageController).
3- No need to worry about security. the simple Test works directly with the POJOs.

Simple (Unit) test now works ( https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/ )

How to skip tests:
mvn -DskipTests=true clean install

Q:
How to set username password.
Why setting manually doesnt work (session).
What is a default security password.

Spring will not remain.

Now AngularJS works.
