folders are important:
moved filed into folder java  (src/main/java)
(also: resources:   src/main/resources )

specified the main (removed the laternative main)
then:
mvn clean install
then
java -jar gs-spring-boot-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

src/main/java
mvn clean install
java -jar gs-spring-boot-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar


how to run commandline:
mvn clean install
java -jar target/gs-spring-boot-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

GET could not sen a "long" variable.
However curl url?uid=2   was fine with String.

In fact the GET method was working correctly.

    //A 'json' is the set of public get*() methods of a POJO.
From stack overflow [David Lotts]: "make sure the POJO you return has get()ers, one for each field."


GET does not work with json input.

Long works (instead of long) in GET.

TODO:
Need to learn:  @PathVariable versus @RequestParam
TODO:
@RequestMapping(method=GET, value={"aa","aa/{id}"})
What does this mean?
TODO:
also a usage: curl  -H "acceptjson..."   "localhost:8080/a/b/getName{a,b}"

We can have (Model model) as the parameters for the "controller" function.

16:18
@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)
//Just narrows the http operations! (GET,PUT,POST)
Wrong! This is needed (*). Otherwise:  {"timestamp":1430407860455,"status":404,"error":"Not Found","message":"No message available","path":"/userfullstate"}
*: When I use @RequestMapping(url) for the class, and not the function. Otherwise, the the URL is not matches to the Function.

@RequestMapping("/userfullstate")
can be wither for a function or a class.

is
@ResponseBody
optional?  (for the function)

Model:
"Primarily designed for adding attributes to the model."

But the object is different each time.
Besides, where is it constructed? Using what parameters?


@NotNull
@Size(max=100)


# MVC
spring.view.prefix=/WEB-INF/jsp/
spring.view.suffix=.jsp

#So will be stored in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jsp
#ref url=?


? May 2015
----------
Use Long as argument

9 May 2015
----------
Model can be provided as an arg or as a member of 
A model as an arg is constructed at each REST request. (then what is the point?)
Why??? #Q #unresolved

A this.model (in the controlle class) is created once. Appears quite early in logs.

Which one is injection then?


@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)
public @ResponseBody UserStateSummaryView method_name_does_not_matter
    (
            @RequestParam(value="uid", required=true)       Long uid
            ,
            UserState tempmodel  //Constructed each time. Then what's the point? #Q
    )
    {...}

11 May 2015:
------------
`@Service` is a subtype of @Component
@Service: "Service", originally defined by Domain-Driven
           * Design (Evans, 2003) as "an operation offered as an interface that stands alone in the
           * model, with no encapsulated state." []

`@Controller`
is typically used in combination with annotated handler methods based on the
 * {@link org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping} annotation.

`java -ea` enables assert
mvn clean install ;blines ;java -ea -jar target/gs-spring-boot-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Works. 16:25 (compiles without error)
Both @Value and @Bean are required.
Q: How to make a Bean that is Injected in properties of two @Components?

echo;curl localhost:8080/userfullstate?uid=2;echo;echo     #exception
echo;curl localhost:8080/userfullstate?uid=7;echo;echo     #works fine. cool.
echo;curl localhost:8080/gamestate;echo;echo               #empty output


Is UserState a Bean? Or is it part of the GameInstance (getter)

UserState is probably Not a bean. [DesignDecision]

Works!
$ echo;curl localhost:8080/gamestate;echo;echo

{"players":[{"publicName":"Jack","summary":{"summary":"Name:Jack OnApp: false","vlong":5},"privateName":"Jack","onScreen":false}],"playerCount":1}


this.gameinstance= sboot.GameInstance@3e94b979
